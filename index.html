        <p>
            I’ve always been passionate about software development and video games, so working
            in the game industry felt like a natural goal for me.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m currently studying game development and I mainly work with
            C++ and C# to build games and technical projects, both at school and on my own.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m highly motivated and constantly looking to improve my skills through
            personal projects and experimentation.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can find a selection of my projects on this website with their respective technical breakdown.
            Each project features screenshots, videos, descriptions, and links to the source code.
