        <p>
            Fish Fighters started as a personal challenge to learn how to structure a larger game project.
            I wanted to move beyond short school assignments and explore what it means to write clean,
            modular, and maintainable code for a real game.
            The result is a tower defense prototype inspired by the mobile game The Battle Cats: simple enough
            to build alone, yet complex enough to test architecture, systems, and workflows.

            <h3>Project Goal</h3>
            <p>
                The primary goal was not to build a highly complex game, but to understand how to design a
                proper codebase.
                I focused on clean architecture, clear separation of responsibilities, and a level of
                modularity that would allow the game to evolve without rewriting everything each time.
            </p>
            <p>
                A tower defense game was a perfect fit. It is achievable on my own, but still involves enough
                systems to create real engineering challenges.

            <h3>What I Built</h3>
            <p>
                I developed everything myself using C++20 and SFML 3.0.
                The project helped me implement several essential systems for 2D game development.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A state machine for all battle entities
                    (BaseState → AttackState, WalkingState, IdleState, etc.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    A custom animation system using TextureRects to scroll through spritesheets
                </li>
                <li>
                    A modular UI framework (UIElement → UIButton, UITexture, UIText) handled by a UIManager
                </li>
                <li>
                    A DataLoader powered by nlohmann::json to load units, enemies, levels, and player saves
                </li>
                <li>
                    A level system managing enemy waves and battle flow
                </li>
                <li>
                    A built-in debug UI using ImGui (spawn entities, give resources, load levels, adjust stats)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tweeny integration for quick, smooth UI and gameplay animations
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                One of the results I am most proud of is the modularity:
                I can add a new enemy, unit, or level simply by editing a JSON file.
                No code changes required. That was a core objective from the start, and it works beautifully.
            </p>
