                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Fish Fighters started as a personal challenge to push myself beyond the short, contained projects I had done before.
                    I wanted to understand what it really takes to structure a larger game, the kind that forces you to think ahead
                    instead of just writing code until it works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A tower-defense game inspired by <em>The Battle Cats</em> felt like the perfect project.
                    It’s simple enough to build alone, but it hides just enough complexity to make you think carefully about architecture,
                    game flow, and data organization. I’ve always loved this game, and creating my own version was a great excuse to learn
                    while also having fun with a concept I care about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project wasn’t about making the flashiest game possible. It was about learning how to build something clean and modular,
                    something that could grow without collapsing under its own weight. Looking back, it became a huge milestone in my progression
                    as a developer.

                <h2>Development Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    From the beginning, my main intention was to write code that felt professional.
                    Not “student project” code, not something you only understand two weeks later — but something structured,
                    readable, and maintainable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to understand how to separate responsibilities properly, avoid hard-coding logic everywhere,
                    make systems modular enough to extend, and create a workflow where adding a new feature doesn’t break everything else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Choosing JSON for all the game data (units, enemies, levels, and even player save data) came naturally.
                    I love how readable the format is, and it fits perfectly with my goal of keeping the game flexible:
                    adding a new enemy or unit requires zero changes in the code. Just update the JSON file and the game adapts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That level of modularity was something I had never achieved before, and I’m truly proud of it.
                </p>

                <h2>Core Systems</h2>

                <h3>State Machine for Battle Entities</h3>
                <p>
                    Each entity (unit or enemy) uses a dedicated state machine with states such as Idle, Walking, or Attack.
                    This helped me better understand behavior-driven architecture and how to cleanly express logic.
                </p>

                <h3>Animation System</h3>
                <p>
                    Animations rely on texture rectangles to scroll through frames inside a sprite atlas — simple but solid.
                </p>

                <h3>UI System</h3>
                <p>
                    I built a small UI framework with a central UIManager for creating buttons, textures, and text elements quickly.
                    It allowed me to prototype menus and interactable elements without cluttering the core game logic.
                </p>

                <h3>Data-Driven Architecture</h3>
                <p>
                    All gameplay data lives in JSON files parsed by a DataLoader system.
                    New units, enemies, and levels can be added entirely through JSON without touching the codebase.
                </p>

                <h3>Level System</h3>
                <p>
                    The LevelController handles wave spawning, pacing, difficulty, and combat flow — all driven by JSON files.
                </p>

                <h3>Debug Tools</h3>
                <p>
                    Using ImGui, I built an in-game debug overlay that lets me spawn units, edit player resources,
                    jump between levels, and toggle features for rapid iteration.
                </p>

                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    This project represents a major step in my evolution as a programmer.
                    It strengthened my understanding of clean architecture, modularity, and long-term maintainability.
                    It also taught me the value of data-driven workflows and how to design systems that scale gracefully.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m proud of how far this project pushed me. Fish Fighters may be a modest prototype,
                    but it helped me understand the difference between “writing code to make things happen”
                    and “designing systems that support a whole game”.
