                    <h2>Overview</h2>

                    <p>
                        During a two-month internship last summer, I worked on several Unity projects aimed at learning
                        the fundamentals of the engine while building my first game-focused portfolio.
                        Each project was designed as a short prototype with a specific learning objective rather than
                        as a fully polished game.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Over the course of the internship, I developed four solo prototypes in the following order:
                        a Pachinko game, a gardening game, a stealth game, and a photography game.
                        Each project introduced new Unity concepts and helped me progressively become more comfortable
                        with the engine, its workflow, and its tools.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <em>Untitled Pachinko Game</em> was my very first Unity project. Its main purpose was to familiarize me
                        with Unity’s 3D tools, basic animations, and particle systems.
                        It served as an introduction to scene construction, simple interactions, and visual feedback.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <em>Hack ’n Escape</em> is a small stealth prototype where I focused on gameplay logic and AI behaviour.
                        Through this project, I learned how to implement simple enemy states, detection logic, and player feedback
                        using Unity’s scripting system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While these projects are relatively small in scope, they represent an important learning phase.
                        More detailed explanations of the technical and design choices can be found in the Technical Breakdown
                        section below.

                <summary>Project Structure & Modular Systems</summary>
                <div class="technical-content">

                    <p>
                        For my Unity projects, I like to separate gameplay logic into multiple small and focused systems.
                        These systems are usually organized as prefabs inside dedicated project folders.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For example, I implemented a <code>ScoreManager</code> system in both projects, but with different responsibilities.
                        In the Pachinko game, it manages the player score.
                        In Hack ’n Escape, it counts how many computers have been hacked in order to unlock the final door.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Organizing logic this way allows me to keep a clear architecture and avoid overly complex prefabs.
                        Each system has a specific role, which makes the project easier to maintain and iterate on.

                    <p>
                        For player controls, I made sure to use Unity’s new Input System and not the legacy Input Manager.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This approach allows me to easily add support for new input devices and control schemes
                        without rewriting gameplay code, while keeping all input logic centralized and scalable.

                    <p>
                        I used Unity’s animation system to bring life to various gameplay elements.
                        In the Pachinko game, several obstacles are animated to move dynamically,
                        preventing players from repeating the same action every time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I also used Unity’s particle system to create clear visual feedback.
                        When the player successfully lands a ball in the center compartment,
                        confetti particles spawn along with a sound effect to reinforce the success.

                <summary>AI & State Machine (Hack ’n Escape)</summary>
                <div class="technical-content">

                    <p>
                        For Hack ’n Escape, I implemented a modular state machine to control the monster’s behavior.
                        Each state follows a simple lifecycle with <code>enter()</code>, <code>perform()</code>, and <code>exit()</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This system worked so well that I later reused the same concept when building the state machine
                        for my C++ project Fish Fighters.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The monster uses Unity’s NavMesh to navigate the level and locate the player.
                        It also relies on raycasts and a cone-based vision system to detect whether the player
                        is in front of it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If the player is detected, the monster starts chasing them.
                        If the player escapes its vision, the monster moves to the last known player position,
                        searches the area for a short time, and then returns to its patrol state.
                        This behavior helps make the monster feel more intelligent and believable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The monster also has a sense of hearing.
                        Opening large doors generates noise that attracts it, triggering an alert state
                        where it moves toward the source of the sound.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This logic was inspired by an

                            AI algorithm
                        </a>
                        I previously implemented for a school project.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Hack ’n Escape was heavily inspired by the Roblox game <em>Flee the Facility</em>,
                        where players must hack computers to escape while being hunted by another player.
                        Similarly, hacking all computers unlocks a final exit door.

                <summary>Audio Feedback & Atmosphere</summary>

                    <p>
                        Audio plays an important role in both projects, especially in Hack ’n Escape.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When the monster detects the player, it lets out a loud scream and an intense
                        background track starts playing.
                        A heartbeat sound also becomes louder as the monster gets closer to the player.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These audio cues help create a tense atmosphere even though the game itself
                        remains relatively simple in terms of mechanics.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the Pachinko game, sound and music are handled by a separate system.
                        Thanks to this separation, I was able to easily add a settings menu
                        to control volume without affecting gameplay logic.

                    <p>
                        I made sure that both games reset properly when the player wins or loses.
                        This allows the player to replay the games indefinitely without restarting the application.
                    </p>

                        All relevant systems are reinitialized correctly, ensuring consistent behavior

                    <p>
                        These Unity projects taught me a lot about both technical implementation
                        and game design.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Hack ’n Escape took around two weeks to complete and involved more complex systems,
                        while the Pachinko game was developed in less than a week and focused on simple but polished mechanics.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Working on these projects helped me better understand Unity’s core systems,
                        project organization, player feedback, and how to scope and polish a prototype
                        under time constraints.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I really enjoyed working with Unity and learning how technical decisions
                        directly impact player experience.
                        These projects played an important role in building my confidence
                        as a game developer.
