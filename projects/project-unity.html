                    <h2>Overview</h2>

                    <p>
                        During a two-month internship last summer, I worked on several Unity projects aimed at learning
                        the fundamentals of the engine while building my first game-focused portfolio.
                        Each project was designed as a short prototype with a specific learning objective rather than
                        as a fully polished game.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Over the course of the internship, I developed four solo prototypes in the following order:
                        a Pachinko game, a gardening game, a stealth game, and a photography game.
                        Each project introduced new Unity concepts and helped me progressively become more comfortable
                        with the engine, its workflow, and its tools.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <em>Untitled Pachinko Game</em> was my very first Unity project. Its main purpose was to familiarize me
                        with Unity’s 3D tools, basic animations, and particle systems.
                        It served as an introduction to scene construction, simple interactions, and visual feedback.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <em>Hack ’n Escape</em> is a small stealth prototype where I focused on gameplay logic and AI behaviour.
                        Through this project, I learned how to implement simple enemy states, detection logic, and player feedback
                        using Unity’s scripting system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While these projects are relatively small in scope, they represent an important learning phase.
                        More detailed explanations of the technical and design choices can be found in the Technical Breakdown
                        section below.

            <h2>Technical Breakdown</h2>

            <details class="technical-section">
                <summary>Project Structure & Modular Systems</summary>
                <div class="technical-content">

                    <p>
                        Both Unity projects were built with a strong focus on clarity and modularity.
                        Even though they are relatively small prototypes, I made a conscious effort to
                        separate responsibilities and avoid tightly coupled scripts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Gameplay logic is organized into small, self-contained systems, usually implemented
                        as prefabs placed in dedicated folders.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For example, I implemented a <code>ScoreManager</code> system in both projects, but with different responsibilities:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>In the Pachinko game, it manages the player score.</li>
                        <li>In Hack ’n Escape, it counts how many computers have been hacked in order to unlock the final door.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Organizing logic this way allows me to keep a clear architecture and avoid overly complex prefabs.
                        Each system has a specific role, which makes the project easier to maintain and iterate on.
                    </p>

                </div>
            </details>

            <details class="technical-section">
                <summary>Input System</summary>
                <div class="technical-content">

                    <p>
                        For player controls, I exclusively used Unity’s new Input System, rather than the legacy Input Manager.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This allowed me to:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Define actions independently from specific input devices.</li>
                        <li>Easily support multiple control schemes.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Using the new Input System made it much easier to adapt controls without touching gameplay code,
                        and it aligns better with modern Unity workflows and scalability.
                    </p>

                </div>
            </details>

            <details class="technical-section">
                <summary>Animations & Particles</summary>
                <div class="technical-content">

                    <p>
                        Unity’s animation system played an important role in both projects, especially for visual clarity and feedback.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the Pachinko game, animations are used to move obstacles dynamically.
                        This prevents players from repeating the same action every time and adds a
                        layer of unpredictability to an otherwise simple mechanic.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I also used Unity’s Particle System to reinforce success states:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Confetti particles spawn when the player scores by landing a ball in the central compartment.</li>
                        <li>These visual effects are paired with sound effects to make success immediately readable and satisfying.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Even though the mechanics are simple, these feedback elements significantly improve
                        the overall feel of the game.
                    </p>

                </div>
            </details>

            <details class="technical-section">
                <summary>AI & State Machine (Hack ’n Escape)</summary>
                <div class="technical-content">

                    <p>
                        Hack ’n Escape was my infiltration-focused prototype and the most technically involved Unity project.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The enemy behavior is built around a modular state machine, designed to stay simple while remaining flexible.
                        Each state follows a clear lifecycle:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><code>enter()</code></li>
                        <li><code>perform()</code></li>
                        <li><code>exit()</code></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        This approach worked so well that I later reused and expanded this exact concept in my C++ project
                        Fish Fighters, adapting it to a different technical context.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Navigation & Perception</h3>

                    <p>
                        The monster uses:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>NavMesh for navigation and pathfinding.</li>
                        <li>Raycasts combined with a cone-based vision check to detect the player.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        When the player enters the monster’s field of view, it switches to a chase state.
                        If the player escapes its vision, the monster does not immediately give up:
                        it moves to the last known player position, searches the area for a short time,
                        and only then returns to its patrol state.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This behavior creates a more believable and “intelligent” enemy without complex algorithms.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Sound Awareness & Alert State</h3>

                    <p>
                        The monster also reacts to sound events.
                        Opening large doors generates noise that attracts the monster, triggering an alert state
                        where it moves toward the source of the sound.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This logic was inspired by an
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuHNmVPDauc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                            AI algorithm
                        </a>
                        I previously implemented for a school project, which helped me translate theoretical concepts
                        into a practical Unity implementation.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Audio & Atmosphere</h3>

                    <p>
                        Audio feedback was used extensively to reinforce gameplay states, especially in Hack ’n Escape.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When the monster detects the player:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>It emits a loud scream.</li>
                        <li>An intense background track starts playing.</li>
                        <li>A heartbeat sound increases in volume as the monster gets closer.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        These layered audio cues create a strong sense of tension, even though the gameplay systems
                        themselves remain relatively simple.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the Pachinko game, audio is handled by a separate sound system, which made it easy to later
                        add a settings menu allowing the player to adjust volume levels without modifying gameplay logic.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Game Flow & Reset Logic</h3>

                    <p>
                        Special care was taken to ensure that both games reset properly after a win or a loss.
                        All relevant systems are reinitialized so the player can replay indefinitely without restarting
                        the application.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This includes resetting:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Scores and progression</li>
                        <li>Enemy states</li>
                        <li>Player position and input state</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        This attention to game flow helped avoid soft locks and made the prototypes feel more complete
                        and polished.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Scope & Production Context</h3>

                    <p>
                        The two showcased Unity projects were developed under different time constraints:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Untitled Pachinko Game was completed in under one week.</li>
                        <li>Hack ’n Escape took approximately two weeks and involved more complex systems.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Both projects were developed solo during a two-month internship, with the main goal of learning
                        Unity fundamentals while building a presentable portfolio.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Two additional prototypes (a gardening game and a photography game) were also created during
                        this period but remained at an early prototype stage and are not showcased here.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What I Learned Working with Unity</h3>

                    <p>
                        Working on these projects helped me build a solid foundation in Unity development:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Structuring projects for clarity and scalability.</li>
                        <li>Designing simple but effective gameplay systems.</li>
                        <li>Using Unity tools (Input System, NavMesh, animation, particles) appropriately.</li>
                        <li>Understanding how feedback, sound, and game feel impact player experience.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Beyond the technical side, these projects taught me a lot about game design and iteration.
                        I particularly enjoyed balancing simplicity and polish, and learning how small details can
                        dramatically improve player perception.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, these Unity projects were a very rewarding learning experience and played an
                        important role in building both my technical skills and my portfolio.
                    </p>
